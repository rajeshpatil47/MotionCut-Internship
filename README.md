# Bucket List application

A BucketList application which you can use to set activities or task you want to do in the future, or you have dont in the past.


# Description

**Details**

My bucket list application is used to set activities which you would love to do in the future, or that you have done in the past.

The application takes on three input from the user in a form which are :

- The Task
- The Date
- Status (Which can take on only one of the three values below)
    - Completed
    - Not Completed
    - Failed

**Technologies**

Technologies i used to build this are React.js and css

I used React.js framework to bootstrap this project because of the below functionalities : 

- Seperation of concerns (Having leaner files and components by breaking down the code into smaller parts)
- Prop drilling to pass some data from component to component with ease.
- Css modules which prevent clashing of classnames around components therefore avoiding unwanted results

# Installation and Running
